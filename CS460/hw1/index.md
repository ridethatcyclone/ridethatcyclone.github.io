## Homework 1
For the first homework we were given the assignment of creating a series of simple webpages, and styling them with CSS and Bootstrap. I was already very familiar with HTML and CSS, but had never used Bootstrap before, so I was intrigued going into this.

Before I could begin diving in with Bootstrap, however, I had to get started with Git first. I've never used Git either, though I had some experience with Mercurial so I wasn't totally in the dark.

I installed Git from https://git-scm.com/ and got started on the web side by creating a repository with an empty README file, so that I could clone it onto my machine. This seemed like an easier path to start with than starting on the machine and syncing it to the repository.

To clone the repository to my system I used the following code in the Git Bash:

```cd Documents CS460_Files
git clone https://github.com/ridethatcyclone/CS460.git
cd CS460
```

The other code I used was simply to commit, push, and pull to/from the repository, as follows:

```git pull origin master
git add index.HTML
git status
git commit -m "a commit message here"
git push origin master
```
