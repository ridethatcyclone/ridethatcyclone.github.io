## Homework 6

For this assignment we were instructed to create an application, using the Northwind 2014 database, that mimicked a shopping site, essentially. It needed to have a two-layer navigation where the user could select a category and subcategory of products. It would then display to the user the products under those selected categories. The user could pick a product and see more details, as well as reviews. The user could also submit a review.

There were a lot of parts to this project, and some parts where definitely more difficult than others, but altogether I think this project came together well.
