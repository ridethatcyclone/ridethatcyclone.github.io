## Welcome

My name is Abby Horner, and I am a senior in Western Oregon University's Computer Science program, graduating in June 2018. This page serves as a landing page for my portfolio. I am excited to be working more on my current coding skills and developing new ones for the future!

### What's with the name?
It's a song (Ride That Cyclone, by Larkin Grimm); I picked the name up a long time ago and it's just stuck with me. I'll get around to changing my GitHub name at some point, but for now, this is who I get to be. If you want to give it a listen: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnMI3OuSIj0)
